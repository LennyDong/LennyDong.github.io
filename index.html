							<h2>Welcome!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hey there! Pleased to meet you and welcome to my website. My name is Lenny and I am a sophomore currently pursuing a Computer Science & Bioengineering double degree at UC Berkeley. I am working as Customer Development for an Oakland-based startup called Ava that aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and the hearing.</p>

							<h3><a href= "https://github.com/LennyDong/Memokee">Memokee</a></h3>
							<p>Never forget another password, again.</p>
						</header>
						<p> Memokee is a simple password storage web application I built with my friend using Node.js, Express.js and Firebase. The insipiration of Memokee came from my very own frustration with my inability to match the correct username & password pair to their corresponding website. With all the varying password requirements different websites and forums have, I have probably created a dozen different versions of the same password at this point. By memorizing just one password, Memokee allows users to  access all of their username & password pairs stored using Firebase's secure database. This is still a work in progress</p>

							<h3><a href ="https://github.com/LennyDong/Gitlet">Gitlet</a></h3>
							<p>Because I needed to learn how Git works.</p>
						</header>
						<p> Gitlet is a VCS that in practice is very similar to that of Git's, but was built using my own data structures and design. Ironically, I went into this school project with very limited knowledge of how to use git, but struggling through this project has solidified my understanding of the beauty behind Git.</p>

							<h3>Customer Development (Oct 2015 - Now)</h3>
							<p><a href = "https://www.ava.me">Ava</a></p>
						</header>
						<p> Ava stands for Auditory Visual Aid. It is an Oakland-based start-up that aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf/hard of hearing and the hearing. I interact with our testers and customers, to make sure their feedbacks are reflected in our product. Listening to how Ava has empowered the deaf and hard of hearing around the world is what drives me forward everyday. </p>

							<h3>CS61A Lab Assistant (Sep - Dec 2015)</h3>
							<p>UC Berkeley</p>
						</header>
						<p> CS61A is probably one of the classes with the most resources here at Berkeley, but it is also one of the most understaffed class given the shear size of the class every semester. I volunteered as a lab assistant for this class and fell in love with the "eureka!" moment students have once they finally understand something. I am planning on applying to become a TA for this class.</p>

							<h3>Vice Chair for 8th Korea America Student Conference (Aug 2014 - Jul 2015)</h3>
							<p>International Student Conference</p>
						</header>
						<p> Korea America Student Conference(KASC) brings together a total of 50 college students from both Korea and America to participate in the month long conference during which they travel and particiapte in various events across the US/South Korea together. I was elected to become one of the ten student leaders to organize the entire conference. We were charged with everything ranging from contacting host universities and transportation logistics, to actually leading the month long conference in July. This remains to be one of my most rewarding experiences - I learned a great deal about my leadership style, and the qualities that are essential to hold such a position.</p>

							<h3>Delegate of 7th Korea America Student Conference (Jul 2014)</h3>
							<p>International Student Conference</p>
						</header>
						<p> I participated in 7th KASC as one of the youngest delegates in the conference. I was part of the Education Roundtable discussion group in which we developed strategies to address the problems that currently exist in the Korean and the American education systems, and our final forum presentation won Best Roundtable Presentation. At the end of the conference, the delegation elected me to become one of the ten student leaders for 8th KASC</p>
